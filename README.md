# flowbot3d

This is a template for a python package with the following features:

* Installable via `pip install`. Anyone can point directly to this Github repository and install your project, either as a regular dependency or as an editable one.
* Uses the new [PEP 518, officially-recommended pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) structure for defining project structure and dependencies (instead of requirements.txt)
* Nice, static documentation website support, using mkdocs-material. Structure can be found in `docs/`
* `black` support by default, which is an opinionated code formatting tool
* `pytest` support, which will automatically run tests found in the `tests/` directory
* `mypy` support, for optional typechecking of type hints
* `pre-commit` support, which runs various formatting modifiers on commit to clean up your dirty dirty code automatically.
* Github Actions support, which runs the following:
    * On a Pull Request: install dependencies, run style checks, run Python tests
    * After merge: same a Pull Request, but also deploy the docs site to the projects Github Pages URL!!!!

All that needs doing is replacing all occurances of `flowbot3d` with the name of your package, the rest should work out of the box!
